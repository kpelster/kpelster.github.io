                <!-- intro -->
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska until I came to the University of Delaware for school.
                    My early years were spent playing every sport and engaging in creative hobbies. Notably, I kept playing soccer, dance, and golf
                     (fun fact - I have had a hole in one before!). My other hobby, which I enjoy the most outside of school and work, is charcoal drawing.
                    While I am pursuing a degree in computer science, interestingly enough, I never took a 
                    computer science course until I started at UD. After being required to take an intro level course
                    and further becoming a lab assistant and teaching assitant, I realized computer science
                    was right for me, and I started my path towards getting a bachelors in Computer Science.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most of my professional experience has actually been in physical science labs. I worked under 
                    a graduate student in the department of Chemical Engineering as a mentee. After that, I spent
                    a few years in a composite materials lab at the Center for Composite Materials. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At last, I began working as a student trainee doing web development for the army at Aberdeen Testing
                    Center in Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. I still work there and I love it!
                    I will be fortunate to be able to start there full time as a Computer Scientist after I graduate in December.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I currently live in Port Deposit, Maryland. It is a quaint little town that I have grown to enjoy thoroughly.
                    I have a dog named Finn, and a cat named Jake. Bonus points if you can name the TV show they are named after ;).
