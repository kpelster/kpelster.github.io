                    <p style = "font-size: initial">In the spring and summer of 2018, I investigated viscoelastic properties of polymer gels 
                        under high pressure for the University of Delaware Department of Chemical Engineering. I prepared and ran experiments to measure properties of the gels.
                        Important experimental skills I learned were multiple particle tracking, rolling ball viscometry
                        and rheometry, and general lab preparatory work. I presented my work at the end of the summer 
                        at the University of Delaware Summer Scholar research symposium.

                        I conducted research on the effect of environmental factors
                        on the aging of Kevlar fibers. My contribution was largely in the prepartion of the
                        experiments and in the analysis of experimental data. I also wrote MATLAB programs to analyze
                        tensile tests. I presented my research at an end-of-summer research symposium.

                        to sulfuric acid and enironmental factors. The work was conducted for the University of Delaware Center for Composite materials.
                        In addition to my contribution being prepare and run experiments, I helped to rewrite MATLAB analysis code to be used not only in this 
                        particular research, but in other similar research projects. I presented my work to the Automotive Composites Conference
                        and Expedition. The Conference was in the August of 2020, so I presented virtually due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. I was awarded
                        first place in the Undergraduate Category.
